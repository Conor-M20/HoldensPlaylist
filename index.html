  <div class="song">
    <div class="title">1. Boulevard of Broken Dreams</div>
    <div class="artist">Green Day</div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio/01.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p> This song captures Holden's belief that the world is full of fake and selfish people. Its 
    lyrics about control and ambtition match his view that adults care too much about power and success.
    Holden doesn't want to play by those rules and he just wants honesty and freedom. The song's calm but 
    serious tone fits how Holden quietly hates/criticizes society without knowing how to change it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="song">
    <div class="title">2. Everybody Wants to Rule The World</div>
    <div class="artist">Tears for Fears</div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio/02.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p> This song connects to Holden's belief that the world is full of fake and selfish people. The 
    words about control and ambition match his view that adults care too much about power and success. 
    Holden doesn't like that and he just wants freedom. </p>

  <div class="song">
    <div class="title">3. Somewhere Only We Know</div>
    <div class="artist">Keane</div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio/04.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p> This song captures Holden's wish to escape reality and find a peaceful place where he can feel safe. 
    The soft melody and emotional lyrics reflect how he misses Allie, he longs for comfort and his childhood.
    Like when he remembers it or thinks about Phoebe. It shows how badly he wants to hold onto something that he misses
    in a world that feels very overwhelming for him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="song">
    <div class="title">4. Eventually</div>
    <div class="artist">Tame Impala</div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio/05.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p> "Eventually" fits Holden's slow realization that change and lose are part of life. The song's sort of
    dreamy, sad tone matches his struggle to accept that he can't stay young or protect everyone he loves. It
    reminds us of how he keeps trying to hold onto the past, even he knows it's slipping away.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="song">
    <div class="title">5. Smells Like Teen Spirit</div>
    <div class="artist">Nirvana</div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio/06.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p> It captures Holden's anger and confusion as a teenager. The song is loud and full of energy, kind of like
    his emotions throughout the book. The rebellious feeling in the definitely fits his frustration with adults and
    the pressure of growing up.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="song">
    <div class="title">6. Stolen Dance</div>
    <div class="artist">Milky Chance</div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="audio/07.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p> This song is like Holden's quiet loneliness mixed with his longing for connection. "I want you by my side so i 
    can never feel alone again" Relates to Holden's wish for connection. And the mentioning of dancing in the song has 
    multiple connections to Holden, as he does love to dance, but the dancing can also be interpreted as connection.
    Also, the song mentions stolen time, i think it can relate to how Holden thinks the world is messing up his childhood
    by you know, stealing his time and such. It reflects how he wishes he could go back to simpler and happier times.</p>
